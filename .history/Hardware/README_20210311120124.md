# Readme for Hardware

Physical changes to hardware (ex 3drag)

Theory of operation, Wiring, addtional electonics.

## Challenges
1. Limited Hardware

---
## Multiple Tool control from limited hardware.

GRBL as standard does not cater for 3+ axis.

but we will have 4 additional motors to control...

- Movement of tools on gantry ( tool changer)
- Each tool's Z axis drive
    - 0.8mm drill
    - 1.0 mm drill
    - laser module

### Design

Send step / dir commands to ALL additional Motor Drivers, but only enable relevant individual driver using it's ENable pin,  MAP each motor driver to separate I/O pins.
| Motor Function | I/O Pin | GCODE | Comment |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| Tool movement on gantry | A3 | M08 | *FLOOD ON*  GCODE M09 switches off |
| Drill 0.8 Z Axis (drill down & up) | A4 | M07 | *MIST ON*   GCODE M09 switches off |
| Drill 1.0 Z Axis (drill down & up) | A6 | Custom M Code | To be added to firmware |
| Laser Module Z Axis (focus distance to work ) | A7 | Custom M Code | To be added to Firmware |

Additionally the PWM Power  / Speed signal from the Controller Board will be switched to the active tool's Power input.
