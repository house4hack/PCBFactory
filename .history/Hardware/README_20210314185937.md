# Readme for Hardware

Physical changes to hardware (ex 3drag)

Theory of operation, Wiring, addtional electonics.

## Challenges
1. Limited Hardware

---
## Multiple Tool control from limited hardware.

GRBL as standard does not cater for 3+ axis.

but we will have 4 additional motors to control...

- Movement of tools on gantry ( tool changer)
- Each tool's Z axis drive
    - 0.8mm drill
    - 1.0 mm drill
    - laser module

### Design

Send step / dir commands to ALL additional Motor Drivers, but only enable relevant individual driver using it's ENable pin,  MAP each motor driver to separate I/O pins.
| Ref | Motor Function | I/O Pin | GCODE | Comment |
|--- |  ------ | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| A | Tool gantry movement | A3 | M07 |  *FLOOD ON*   GCODE M09 switches off  |
| B | Drill 0.8 Z Axis (drill down & up) | A4 | M08 | *MIST ON*    GCODE M09 Switches off|
| C | Drill 1.0 Z Axis (drill down & up) | A6 | ??? | Custom M code  - To be added to Firmware  |
| D | Laser Module Z Axis (focus distance to work ) | A7 | ???? | Custom M code  - To be added to Firmware  |


Additionally the PWM Power  / Speed signal from the Controller Board will be switched to the active tool's Power input.

## Gantry design & Tool positioning

The Gantry will be a section of 'C' V-SLOT aluminim sxtrusion, fixed to the machines vertical uprights.
mounted on this Section, will be a single sliding plate, that is wide enough to mount all three tools.  This plate will be moved left to right to position the plate so that relevant tool is in the correct working position by a stepper motor *REF A*

Without any tool selected, this lateral tool mount plate will be driven as the Z axis. ( including homing )

Each tool on the plate will have a pre-set offset from Home, that will position the specific tool at the normal active position.

`
M09;  Switch off all tools - z moves not move tool gantry
G1 Z100; move tool gantry so that tool # 1 is in the "active" position.
M07:  Direct step & direction movement commands to the Tool #1 z axis motor
G91; use relative moves


## Spindle design

## Laser mount design
