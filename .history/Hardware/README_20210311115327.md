# Readme for Hardware

Physical changes to hardware (ex 3drag)

Theory of operation, Wiring, addtional electonics.

## Multiple Tool control from limited hardware.

GRBL as standard does not cater for 3+ axis.

but we will have 4 additional motors to control...

- Movement of tools on gantry ( tool changer)
- Each tool's Z axis drive
    - 0.8mm drill
    - 1.0 mm drill
    - laser module

### Design 1:
Send step / dir commands to ALL additional Motor Drivers, but only enable relevant individual driver using it's ENable pin,  MAP each motor driver to separate I/O pins.
1. Tool movement on gantry - [ GCODE M08 ] *FLOOD ON*  GCODE M09 switches off
2. Drill 0.8 Z Axis (drill down & up) = [ GCODE M07 ] *MIST ON*   GCODE M09 switches off
3. Drill 1.0 Z Axis (drill down & up) =  Custom M code wired to PIN A6
4. Laser Module
M Using GRBL's existing Z axis movement capability, e
