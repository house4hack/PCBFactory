# PCBFactory
a major impediment to be able to realise our projects quickly is the process to manufacture the PCBs required.  Chinese companies like PCBWay and JLPCB provide exeptional service and low cost, but even with (for the industry) very short turn around times, this still means that projects are put on hold for a few weeks.

The danger of this delay is that it allows Squirrels[^1] to manifest! To combat the Squirrels, we decided we needed a quick way to prototype PCBs, and the PCB Factory was born! *Note, this project was the result of a squirrel, which just goes to show how insiduos these wretched beasts are!*

In a previous life, this project is the offspring of dubios parents.

The physical Hardware started its life as a 3d Printer called 3drag (https://reprap.org/wiki/3drag). It was donated to House4Hack and after not getting any love for a while, it was repurposed as the base for our PCB Factory.

The Controlling Software is the next evolution/remix of a stalled project that combined vision and CNC control to automate the drilling of etched PCBs.

Unlike the above, the CNC control software for the Hardware is based on the excellent [GRBL project](https://github.com/gnea/grbl)

## Theory of Operation:
We start with a blank PCB, which we coat with a protective layer of paint [^2] or UV curable film. The PCBFactory will then burn away the protective layer around the tracks and leave a protective layer over the tracks so that when we etch the board, the protected areas are not etched away and only the unprotected areas are etched away. Furthermore it will be able to drill all the neccessary holes, and even mill the edges.

## Current features:

1. It can move in X,Y,Z

## Next steps:

- [x] Add enstops  * done 9/3/21 *
- [ ] Add a box below for the electronics.
- [x] Control laser power via PWM  * done 9/3/21 *




## Future development:
### MVP1:
1. A laser to burn away uv curable film or paint, so that we can etch the board.
2. A drill to drill holes for components.

### MVP2:
1. Be able to do a double sided board.

### MVPz:
1. Add a camera to calculate the rotation of the PCB.

### MVPy:
1. Have multiple drill heads with different sizes.

### MVPx:
1. Be able to do isolation routing of a PCB.

### MVPw:
1. Be able to do edge milling of a PCB.

[^1]: 'Squirrels' is the term used to describe the danger and temptation that newer, sexier projects become more attractive to the maker than the current project that has been delayed.  As in "Look! A Sqirrel!"

[^2]: Paint must be Acrylic Spray Paint - See allow to dry completely before lasering.  more coats == more lasing but better "potential" resistance to etching.  Lasing paint leaves carbonised paint residue, this **MUST** be removed before etching.  Possibe.
