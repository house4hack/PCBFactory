# PCBFactory
The PCB Factory started its life as a 3d Printer called 3drag (https://reprap.org/wiki/3drag). It was donated to House4Hack and after not getting any love for a while, it was repurposed as the base for our PCB Factory.

## Theory of Operation:
We start with a blank PCB, which we coat with a protective layer of paint or UV curable film. The PCBFactory will then burn away the protective layer around the tracks and leave a protective layer over the tracks so that when we etch the board, the protected areas are not etched away and only the unprotected areas are etched away. Furthermore it will be able to drill all the neccessary holes, and even mill the edges.
 

## Current features:
1. It can move in X,Y,Z

## Next steps:
1. Add enstops
2. Add a box below for the electronics. 


## Future development:
### MVP1:
1. A laser to burn away uv curable film or paint, so that we can etch the board.
2. A drill to drill holes for components.

### MVP2:
1. Be able to do a double sided board.

### MVPz:
1. Add a camera to calculate the rotation of the PCB.

### MVPy: 
1. Have multiple drill heads with different sizes.

### MVPx:
1. Be able to do isolation routing of a PCB.

### MVPw:
1. Be able to do edge milling of a PCB.
